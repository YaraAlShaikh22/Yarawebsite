    <p>Dogs are the most popular pet on the planet! <br>
They evolved from a now-extinct species of wolf! <br>
They can learn over 100 words and gestures! <br>
Dog noses are at least 40x more sensitive than ours! <br>
Many work as assistance dogs, helping humans! <br>
They only sweat from their paws, and have to cool down by panting!</p>
